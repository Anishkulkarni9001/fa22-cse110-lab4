# Part 1 - Solutions

1. Here, the output is "values added: 20".
   
2. Here, the output is "final result: 20".
   
3. Here, the output is again "values added: 20".

5. Here, the code has an error - we declared 'result' as a constant, so reassigning it flags an error.

6. Here, we also have an error - 'result' still has a block scope, so referencing it outside the conditional causes an error.
